## Overview

### The Theme

Users should be able to:

-   A Quiz Detail Screen from which the user can start the quiz.
    -   A simple UI where the user can see information about the quiz and start the quiz will suffice.
-   A Quiz Attempt Screen where the user will take the quiz.
    -   The quiz will have multiple MCQ questions with one correct answer for each question.
    -   The quiz must be time bound, i.e. the user will have 30 seconds to complete the quiz, after which it should auto submit.
-   Play the trailer when the image card is clicked and stop the trailer when again clicked on the image.
    -   A simple UI showing the userâ€™s score.

## My process

### Built with

-   Mobile First Approach
-   HTML5
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

-   Get more familiar with useEffect hook and its different ways.
-   Get more familiar with transition and transform CSS property.
-   Get more familiar with animations in CSS.
-   Get more familiar with mobile first approach.
-   Get more familiar with setTimeout andn setInterval functions.

### Continued development

In this project, I also wanted to do a round or linear progress bar for the timer and I also wanted to add randomised questions and answers when restarted the quiz.
